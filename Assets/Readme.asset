  - heading: Universal Render Pipeline
    text: 'This template is a good starting point for game and app developers that
      are focussed on platform reach. The Universal Render Pipeline (URP) offers
      both real-time lighting and baked lighting in a single-pass forward renderer.
      This decreases the amount of necessary draw calls, making URP ideal for Projects
      that must scale across platforms, including mobile hardware. '
